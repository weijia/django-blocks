Django is a great framework. It's easy to learn and use. Building a site in it is easy. But why re-invent the wheel each time? The goal of **django-blocks** is to be able do do a site without a real need to write many lines of code (or any) because almost common stuff like a _content_ and how it should be shown will be configured by the user. It should be easy to do a **Blog** (like WordPress) or some other kind of **CMS based site** (like in Drupal) easily.

If you need more information or be part of the team please contact. Any help would be appreciated.
